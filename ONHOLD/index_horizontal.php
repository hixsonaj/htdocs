          <h1>Volume by Speed</h1>
          <p>Speed by Volume is my first public project and my biggest by far. It is an App on the Google Play Store available for anyone to download.</p>
          <p>You can see the Goole Play Listing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.zerofour.volumebyspeed&hl=en_US&gl=US">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Volume by Speed will adjust the volume of the device by a function of the devices speed. The rate at which the volume increases can be changed to better fit the users needs. The app can be useful for driving when road noise varies from driving speed. Similarly it can be used with biking or skiing to counteract wind noise.</p>
