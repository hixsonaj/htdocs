          <h1>About Zero Four</h1>
          <p>Zero Four is an LLC registered in Washington State. Zero Four is a platform for me (Alex Hixson) to showcase my projects and career progression. Currently, there's no defined purpose behind it, but if you want you could call it a tech startup. It's just me running everything, so things move slowly, but I try to always be working on something.</p>

          <h1>About Alex Hixson</h1>
          <p>I go to San Diego State University, majoring in computer science, and expect to graduate in 2026. I want to work in the tech industry both because it's extremely profitable and because I genuinely enjoy computer science and building things myself. As a college student, I don't have a ton of time or money to work on big projects, but I try to use my time wisely.</p>
