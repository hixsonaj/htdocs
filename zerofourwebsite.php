        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>zerofour.tech is the website you're on right now! It was made as a center for Zero Four and showcases all my past and current projects. It's built mostly in HTML and CSS but uses a little bit of PHP. The website is simple and small and didn't take an extreme amount of time to make but I'm still proud of it. I didn't love web development when I built and put this website up in January 2022 but working on it now in October 2022, I really enjoy it. I plan to continuously improve it and keep it up to date with my projects and career but nothing extreme.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>I bought the domain zerofour.tech in January 2022 so I could showcase my progress in the tech field. That’s pretty much it. I’ve made some updates here and there with the biggest being in October 2022, but the idea and the technology have remained the same.</p>
        <p>I also bought alexhixson.com when I bought zerofour.tech cause there was some discount. I currently don’t have hosting for it, so it just redirects to here.</p>

      <section id="technical">
        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <p>The website uses PHP to include the header and footer on each page. Other than that, it’s all in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses some fancy animations on the home page which was kind of fun to build but not overly complex. It uses two different CSS files to format it differently for mobile and desktop which was kind of a pain to implement but not technically difficult.</p>

      <section id="success">
        <h2>Success</h2>
        <p>I don’t have any metrics tracking views or clicks so I can’t say if it’s a huge hit, but that was never really the intention. It came out the way I intended it to so I would say that makes it pretty successful.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="future">
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>I plan to keep it updated with reports on current and past projects and anything else I find interesting.</p>
        <p>Also plan to have alexhixson.com redirect to a subdomain of zerofour.tech and do something goofy with that. That way I don’t have to pay for hosting of alexhixson.com but can still use it in almost the same way.</p>
